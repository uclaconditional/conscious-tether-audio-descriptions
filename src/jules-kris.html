        Hanging from the ceiling are a number of copies of a single zine made with different colors of ink and on different
        papers. The zine depicts a number of hands cut from other publications, holding one another at different scales. There is
        small text written around the hands. The zines are connected with paper clips and stand all in all about 10 feet tall,
        extending all the way to the ceiling of the space.
