        A large video projected on the wall. The video is about 12 feet tall and 18 feet wide. In front of the video is a long
        wooden bench. On the bench sit two small wireless radios, with antenna sticking in the air. The radios are tuned to
        station 87.5. Turning up the volume of the radios reveals that they are playing the sound for the video. The video is
        composed of found footage, and original video from around what looks to be New York City. The video features subtitles,
        matching the audio heard through the radios.
