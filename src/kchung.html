        The first thing you notice upon approaching this piece is its similarity to a DJ booth. There are two turntables with a
        mixer set between them, all sitting on a plywood desk-like structure. Next to the large desk are two wooden columns each
        with a speaker. Unlike a typical DJ booth, the mixer is facing the front. Each turntable is playing a record. The arms
        of the turntables are tied in place with thin red threads. This causes the record to be stuck playing a short loop. The
        sound is occasionally overwhelming as the two loops intersect one another. Upon closer inspection at the turntable, one
        notices that the turntable on the left is playing at 33 RPMs, while the one on the right is set to 45 RPMs. The back of
        the desk is open, revealing a collection of records of different types, jazz, experimental, classical, and minimalist.
