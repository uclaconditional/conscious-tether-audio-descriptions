        There is a desk against the wall with a chair sitting in front of it. On the desk are two computers or rather cardboard
        versions of computers. One appears to be an old large CRT computer like something from the 90s. There is a small LCD
        screen in the middle of the cardboard monitor. The other computer looks like a large chunky laptop, again made out of
        cardboard. Both are painted a slightly yellow white. They each have their own video screen, showing a looping video of
        people going to public spaces and connecting to different wireless networks.

        Next to the computers is a legal paper size black box. In the box are four zines,
        one titled "booting tales, aka, bios fun”,
        another called “the LA Cryptoparty primer”,
        the third is titled "email encryption 101 for Mac”
        and the fourth is “make your own anonymous identity. Burner phone's, laptops, accounts,
        and log-ins.”
