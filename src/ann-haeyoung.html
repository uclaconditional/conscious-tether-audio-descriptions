        On the wall is a large television screen, flat panel, playing a video on repeat. In front of the television, there is a
        long bench with a pair of headphones. The video is primarily composed of slow, nearly still, shots of what appears to be
        a small town. We see street signs, signs with directions to mines, and many signs list minerals available in the area.

      <p>From the artist:</p>
      <blockquote>
        "Mining is a Violence That Happens Here" reflects on the materiality of technology, and the alienation we experience
        from the production of our devices. Focusing on the extraction of ultra-pure quartz, a mineral mined almost exclusively
        in Spruce Pine, NC, the film meditates on narratives of technological progress and the impacts of resource extraction.
