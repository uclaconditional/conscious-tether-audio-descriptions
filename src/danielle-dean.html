        A large painting 46 inches tall by 80 inches wide is hanging on the wall. The painting is framed in dark brown wood. The
        painting is clearly watercolor and depicts a nondescript tropical scene with sandy mountains in the background, green
        fields in the middle ground filled with palm trees and lakes, and in the foreground what appears to be small cliffs or
        excavated land with water running through it. In the top left of the frame there is also a large coconut tree. Floating
        on top of the watercolor, on the glass of the frame, are a series of elements from computer interfaces.

      <p>From the artist:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The work adopts a layered structure, wherein an illustration of a CAPTCHA interface materially overlays the painted
          image. Websites use CAPTCHA to ensure that a given user is not a bot by asking the user to identify certain objects,
          read warped text, and other tasks that an artificial intelligence would not be able to complete. CAPTCHA thus defines
          what behaviors are considered human.

          Dean culls her lush watercolor imagery from midcentury Ford advertisements: set dressing for the aspirational lifestyle
          offered by automobile ownership. Henry Ford is famous for having implemented the assembly line model of manufacture,
          which allowed for production—and consumption—at unprecedented scales. Rather than relying on specialized labor, Fordism
          established the model of unskilled laborers operating specialized machines to produce and assemble interchangeable
          parts. Fordism offered a machinic model for administrating labor, in which the human worker itself amounts to an
          interchangeable part. Labor thus became modular, undifferentiated, and infinitely replaceable, qualities which Dean
          identifies among present-day digital work. Gig workers such as those contracted through Amazon Mechanical Turk often
          perform simple tasks such as CAPTCHA recognition so that artificial intelligence can learn from human behavior. If
          Fordism rendered the human a cog in the machine, present-day online precarity workers toil toward their own
          obsolescence, providing the material from which AI might edge closer to human capability.

          The fantasies of pleasure, leisure, and comfort espoused by corporate advertising obscure the labor regimes that sustain
          those fantasies. Dean visualizes the historical strata that underwrite contemporary interactions with technology,
          indicating that the definition of “human” is malleable, contingent, and exploitable.;
