        A large painting 46 inches tall by 80 inches wide is hanging on the wall. The painting is framed in dark brown wood. The
        painting is clearly watercolor and depicts a nondescript tropical scene with sandy mountains in the background, green
        fields in the middle ground filled with palm trees and lakes, and in the foreground what appears to be small cliffs or
        excavated land with water running through it. In the top left of the frame there is also a large coconut tree.
        On the glass of the frame, are a series of elements from computer interfaces which overlap the painting.
