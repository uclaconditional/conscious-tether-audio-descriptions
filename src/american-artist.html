        A freestanding sculpture in the center of the room, 96 inches tall, 96 inches wide, and 96 inches deep, a
        rather imposing form if solid, but here only the edges of the cube are present. The sculpture appears to be a measurement
        device, with axis set up on the x, y, and z dimensions. The interior of the cube is reminiscent of a precision
        measurement device, with precise labeling and tick marks. It is a black frame, with the top and bottom, left and right,
        sides connected by black beams. The horizontal beams are labeled “-sur” at left and "+sur" at right.
        The vertical axis is labeled “+sous” at the top and "-sous" at the bottom.

        The outer frame is made of inexpensive, possibly scrap wood. The frame describes a complete cube, holding the interior
        frame in the middle. The wooden frame is written on with marker and spray paint notes inspired by the writings of Simone
        Browne on different types of surveillance and resistance to it, as well as their impact on Black lives.
