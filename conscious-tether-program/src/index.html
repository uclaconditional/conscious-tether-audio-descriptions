    <h1>Conscious Tether: Art and the Internet in Los Angeles</h1> is a group exhibition of
    contemporary artists considering what it means to live with and through the internet.
  </header>
  <section class="intro">
    <p>
      Appearing to be both nowhere and everywhere at once, the internet’s presence is always <strong>felt</strong>, always there, always just
      outside the bounds of perception. Parallel to the common perception within media theory that infrastructures and
      apparatuses only make themselves known during instances of breakdown or failure, Conscious Tether feels out the sites at
      which matter, energy, and labor assert themselves amidst conditions of invisibility, control, and waste. These artists
      prize apart how the networked, digitized subject might respond to the state of ceaseless onlineness; at the same time,
      the exhibition also asks what role the real space of Los Angeles plays within these complex interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The internet’s inaugural message sent from UCLA’s Boelter Hall reached its destination, but was incomplete. The
      four-node network crashed after the first two letters—LO—of “LOGIN.” This initial semi-failure or partial transmission
      seems in retrospect, given the intervening histories and usages, emblematic of all that is in excess of the internet and
      yet could no longer exist without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assembled artists in Conscious Tether emphasize the material and immaterial
      reminders of the internet’s unceasing presence, exploring its seeming peripheries. <strong>American Artist</strong>, <strong>ann haeyoung</strong>, and
      <strong>Romi Morrison</strong> implicate systems of quantification, control, and extraction; <strong>LA Cryptoparty</strong>, <strong>KCHUNG</strong>, <strong>Danielle Dean</strong>, <strong>Tiny
      Tech Zines (Rachel Simanjuntak, Jules Kris, Tyler Yin, Tristan Espinoza)</strong>, and <strong>Xin Xin</strong> consider practices of labor,
      privacy, and consent; while works by <strong>Ahree Lee</strong>, <strong>Devin Kenny</strong>, and <strong>Alice Yuan Zhang</strong> reveal both the realities and possible
      futures of gendered technology, encryption, and technological ruins. Conscious Tether celebrates and acknowledges these
      peculiar intransigences, to stay with the trouble that rubs up against the gridded globe of the “World Wide Web.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious Tether features work by Ahree Lee, Alice Yuan Zhang, American Artist, ann haeyoung, Danielle Dean, Devin
      Kenny, KCHUNG, LA Cryptoparty, Romi Morrison, Tiny Tech Zines (Rachel Simanjuntak, Jules Kris, Tyler Yin, Tristan
      Espinoza), and Xin Xin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Co-curated by Chandler McWilliams and Audrey Min, with public programming organized by Daniel Soto and Casey Reas.
