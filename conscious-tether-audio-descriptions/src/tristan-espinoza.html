        Mounted in the corner of the gallery are two televisions, approximately 3 feet tall and 2 feet wide. They are hung in
        portrait orientation, in the corner so that one long edge is touching. The screen on the left shows a video of computer
        animated neurons with constantly changing text. The screen on the right shows another video, similar in format, with 3d
        computer animations of blood vessels and other parts of the body. Both of the videos have a larger blurred version, full
        screen, in the background with a smaller square inset of the same video, but in focus. Under the inset are constantly
        changing words.
