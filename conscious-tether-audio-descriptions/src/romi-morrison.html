        This piece is composed of a set of long hand woven black fabric strips, each about 12 feet long. The strips overlap and are
        gathered at the top to create a structure, vaguely resembling a minaret. The hand woven strips are primarily black with
        the occasional stripe of tan or red. The sculpture is hollow in the bottom, inviting viewers to come inside. Entering
        this sculpture triggers a soundscape that can be heard above the audience.

      <p>From the artist:</p>
      <blockquote>
        The Future Conditional is an interactive sound sculpture that explores Black diasporic practices of encoding, weaving,
        oral histories, and divination. This project speculates on the form of the database server, an ubiquitous feature of
        digital infrastructures that is often hidden from view. Combining West African narrow loom weaving traditions, binary
        divination practices, proximity sensors, and sound design this server requires viewers to build a relationship to it to
        have access to its information. An oral database plays from the sculpture crafted from conducted interviews and Ô¨Åeld
        recordings taken on historic sites of Black maroon settlements. Interviews were held with prominent Black feminist
        scholars and artists on the topic of Black futures. Using a machine learning model the sculpture senses for the
        proximity and duration of time that the viewer spends with the work. As the viewer spends more time, different
        components of the oral database become audible. This work invites the viewer into a relationship with the database form,
        not as an inert piece of hardware but as a contingent relationship that requires your presence and time.
