        The sculpture is composed of a free-standing steel structure about 5 1/2 feet tall, 2 feet deep, and 2 feet wide. Hanging
        on the structure is a hand woven textile in green and gold colors. The textile itself is about 2.5 feet tall and 18 inches wide.
        On the textile there is a round circuit
        board and two LED lights, one yellow, one blue. The blue LED is about 5” from the top, and 9” from the left. The yellow
        LED sits about 10” from the top and 6” from the left and blinks more quickly. Both LEDs display a discernible pattern.
        Only one of the LEDs is blinking at a time. Walking around to the back of the structure, one can see a faint light
        through the fabric.

      <p>From the artist:</p>
      <blockquote>
        I was inspired by the anecdote about the failed first internet transmission resulting in the message “L O”, so the two
        LEDs in the weaving blink the letters “L” and “O” in Morse code.
