        Sitting on a short plinth about 10 inches tall is an old Sony CRT television. The screen is slightly warped glass and
        about 12 inches square. On the screen is a website with a list of words, each with a checkbox next to them. Underneath a
        list of words are a text that says "first shift, 8 AM to 4 PM, one hour, 28 minutes remain."" Around the grouping of words
        is a thin frame, and at the top of the frame are a set of underscores, seven in total, with a question mark at the end.
        Using the mouse sitting next to the screen, words can be selected. When a correct sequence is chosen, an image comes into
        focus in the background.
